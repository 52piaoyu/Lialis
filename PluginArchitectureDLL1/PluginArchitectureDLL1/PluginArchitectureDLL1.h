// The following ifdef block is the standard way of creating macros which make exporting
// from a DLL simpler. All files within this DLL are compiled with the PLUGINARCHITECTUREDLL1_EXPORTS
// symbol defined on the command line. This symbol should not be defined on any project
// that uses this DLL. This way any other project whose source files include this file see
// PLUGINARCHITECTUREDLL1_API functions as being imported from a DLL, whereas this DLL sees symbols
// defined with this macro as being exported.
//#ifdef PLUGINARCHITECTUREDLL1_EXPORTS
//#define PLUGINARCHITECTUREDLL1_API __declspec(dllexport)
//#else
//#define PLUGINARCHITECTUREDLL1_API __declspec(dllimport)
//#endif

//// This class is exported from the dll
//class PLUGINARCHITECTUREDLL1_API CPluginArchitectureDLL1 {
//public:
//	CPluginArchitectureDLL1(void);
//	// TODO: add your methods here.
//};
